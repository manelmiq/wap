opens our awareness to the expanded vision of
unbounded awareness, at the same time that it promotes
the ability to focus sharply within any local boundaries.

1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):
    <pre>
    x = 1;
    var a = 5;
    var b = 10;
    var c = function(a, b, c) {
        var x = 10;
        document.write(x);
        document.write(a);
        var f = function(a, b, c) {
            b = a;
            document.write(b);
            b = c;
            var x = 5;
        }
        f(a,b,c);
        document.write(b);
    }
    c(8,9,10);
    document.write(b);
    document.write(x);
    }
        10, 8, 8, 9, 10, 1
    </pre>


    <p>2. What is the difference between a method and function?</p>
        A function is a regular function, a method is a special function associate with an object.
    <p>3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?</p>
        this refer to the class of the object is calling. Can be a method or even a field.

    <p>4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?</p>
        
        According to w3 school this has thoses kind of uses 
        
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp"> W3School</a>
        
         The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.

        <ul>
            <li>It has different values depending on where it is used:</li>
            <li>In a method, this refers to the owner object.</li>
            <li>Alone, this refers to the global object.</li>
            <li>In a function, this refers to the global object.</li>
            <li>In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.</li>
            <li>In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.</li>
            <li>Methods like call(), and apply() can refer this to any object.</li>
        </ul>

    <p>5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?</p>
        This is refer to create new proprieties to objects. the proprieties can only be created in the constructor.


    <p>6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'.
        When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?</p>

Refers to the object who is calling the method


<p>7. What is a free variable in JavaScript?</p>
Free Variable: Free variables are simply the variables that are neither locally declared nor
passed as parameter. We know about scope in JavaScript, We create private variables to enable encapsulation.
To write Function or variables created in a function has local scope and not accessible out from that function blocks.


<p>8. Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function
    that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.</p>

<pre>

var number_8 ={
    name: "fred",
    major: "Music",
    math : function (x, y) {
        return (x !== y) ? Math.min(x, y) :
            x+"^2=" + Math.pow(x, 2) + "\n" + y +"^2=" + Math.pow(y, 2);
    }
};


</pre>


<p>9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function.
    Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.</p>

<pre>


function employee (name, salary, position) {
   this.name = name,
   this.salary = salary,
   this.poisition = position
}

employee1 = new employee("joe", 100000, "senior programmer");
employee2 = new employee("ana", 90000, "jr programmer");
employee3 = new employee("bete", 110000, "software enginnering");

console.log(employee1);
console.log(employee2);
console.log(employee3);
</pre>


<p>10. Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
    arguments.</p>

<pre>
function products(){
    var product = 1;
    for(let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++){
        product *= arguments[i];
    }
    return product;
}
console.log(products(2, 2));
console.log(products(4, 2));
console.log(products(4, 2, 8));

</pre>


<p>11. Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.</p>


<pre>
const max3 = (x, y, z ) => {return Math.max(x, y, z)};
console.log(max3(1, 2, 3));
</pre>
