<b>1. Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the problems?</b>

<p>Yes. The problem you will lose the request parameters after the requisition.</p>

<b>2. What is the purpose of request dispatching?</b>

<p>The RequestDispatcher interface provides the facility of dispatching the request to another resource it may be html,
    servlet or jsp. This interface can also be used to include the content of another resource also. It is one of the
    way of servlet collaboration.</p>

<b>3. What is the difference between redirect and request dispatch?</b>
<p>The RequestDispatcher interface allows you to do a server side forward/include whereas sendRedirect() does a client
    side redirect.
    SendRedirect() will search the content between the servers. it is slow because it has to intimate the browser by
    sending the URL of the content. then browser will create a new request for the content within the same server or in
    another one.
    RquestDispatcher is for searching the content within the server i think. its the server side process and it is
    faster compare to the SendRedirect() method. but the thing is that it will not intimate the browser in which server
    it is searching the required date or content, neither it will not ask the browser to change the URL in URL tab. so
    it causes little inconvenience to the user.0

<b>4. What is an attribute ?</b>
<p>An object bound into one of the three servlet API objects
    • HttpServletRequest
    • HttpSession
    • ServletContext</p>
<b>5. What is the difference between attributes and parameters?</b>
<p>Parameters are read-only. Attributes are read/write. Attribute can be the whole object and parameters are only
    string </p>

<b>6. What are dangers of using attributes?</b>
<p>Shared by every request and every servlet in the application. Can lead to thread safe problems</p>

<b>7. What does it mean to say that http is stateless? Give an example of a stateful protocol.</b>
<p>Because once the transaction between the server ends the information is lost. </p>

<b>8. Give 5 different methods for maintaining state information (count each attribute scope as one method).</b>

<ol>
    <li>Request Scope</li>
    <li>Session Scope</li>
    <li>Application scope</li>
    <li>Cookies</li>
    <li>Hidden forms</li>
</ol>

<b>9. How long does a session last?</b>
<p>By default the session last 30 minutes. You can customize the time.</p>
<b>10. What is a cookie, and how long does a cookie last?</b>
<p>Cookie is a file that stays on the browser on the client side to important state maintance. usually last 2 to 3 weeks</p>
<b>11. What is the purpose of URL rewriting?</b>
<p>You can pass parameters throw the URL and alter the content to the beck-end. The problem is that you open to hacker problems. </p>

<b>12. Why does the request attribute report ‘null’ for the maintaining state demo?</b>
<p>Because the request is destroyed.</p>
