<p>1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements?</p>
1.1 setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
<br>
1.2 setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);

<pre>1.1 Executes instantaneously.
    1.2 Executes after 2 seconds</pre>


<p>2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?</p>
<pre>
        var myfunc = function(a, x) {
        return a * x;
        };
        var x = myfunc(2, 3);
        var y = myfunc;
        alert(x);
        alert(y(2,3));

    the first alert(x) -> 6
    the second alert(x) -> 6
</pre>
<p>3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that
    says “BOOYAH!”</p>
<pre>
setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);

    function booyah1() {
        alert("BOOYAH1");
    }

function booyah2() {
    setTimeout(function () {
        alert("BOOYAH2");
    }, 2000);
}

setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);

<p>4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons
    for using it)?</p>
    <pre>
        Unobtrusive JavaScript is a best practice methodology for attaching JavaScript to the front-end of a website.
        It’s an ideal to strive toward and something we should bear in mind whenever we’re adding JavaScript to a site.
It is the separation of behaviour from markup or structure. Just like the CSS gurus of old taught us there
        should be a separation of layout from markup, there should be a separation of behaviour from markup.
        That’s HTML for the content and structure of the document, CSS for the layout and style, and Unobtrusive
        JavaScript for behaviour and interactivity. Simple.
